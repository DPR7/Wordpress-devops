Filters are functions that WordPress uses to pass data through. 
Passing data through filters allows developers to modify the default behavior 
of a specific function. 
Functions used to filter data are called hooks. 
Filters and Actions together allow developers great flexibility 
to modify default WordPress filters and actions and even
create their own custom filters and actions so that other 
developers can extend their plugins or themes.
