Registering a Sidebar #Registering a Sidebar

To use sidebars, you must register them in functions.php.

To begin, register_sidebar() has several parameters that should always be defined 
regardless of whether they are marked as optional. These include x, y, and z.

name – your name for the sidebar. This is the name users will see in the Widgets panel.
id – must be lowercase. You will call this in your theme using the dynamic_sidebar function.
description – A description of the sidebar. This will also be shown in the admin Widgets panel.
class – The CSS class name to assign to the widget’s HTML.
before_widget – HTML that is placed before every widget.
after_widget – HTML that is placed after every widget. Should be used to close tags from before_widget.
before_title – HTML that is placed before the title of each widget, such as a header tag.
after_title – HTML that is placed after every title. Should be used to close tags from before_title.
To register a sidebar we use register_sidebar and the widgets_init function.
