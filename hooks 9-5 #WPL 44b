Description #Description
WordPress offers filter hooks to allow plugins to modify various types of 
internal data at runtime.

A plugin can modify data by binding a callback to a filter hook. 
When the filter is later applied, each bound callback is run in order of priority,
and given the opportunity to modify a value by returning a new value.

The following example shows how a callback function is bound to a filter hook.

Note that $example is passed to the callback, (maybe) modified, then returned:

<code>
function example_callback( $example ) {
    // Maybe modify $example in some way.
    return $example;
}
add_filter( 'example_filter', 'example_callback' );

</code>
